## Project Development and Planning 

The planning and development of this website was done using principles of User Experience (UX) design, which include the five planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. With these principles in mind, the aim was to ensure an easy-to-use, responsive and eye-catching website to meet the goals and needs of potential clients interested in booking a Safari holiday.

### Project Goals 

#### Project Purpose

- The Sable Safari website is a site for tourists and local travellers looking to visit Zimbabwe and book an exciting safari getaway. Sable Safari is a made-up Safari getaway which offers accommodation and activities to meet the needs of all types of travellers: from adrenaline-junkies to wildlife enthusiasts, and even people who simply want to relax and enjoy the African sunset. 

- Users will be able to find general information about the Safari getaway, as well as the various activities they can indulge in upon arrival. They can also look at the types of rooms they'd like to stay in, and make enquiries through the enquiry form page. 

#### Target Audience

- Sable Safari is designed for users who are interested in booking a safari holiday in Zimbabwe, and offers easy-to-navigate pages to allow travellers to get a feel of what is offered. 
- Given it's simplicity, both adults and children have the freedom to scroll through the pages and make a booking. 

#### User Goals 
- To have a professional, bold and welcoming appearance, to attract travellers who may be interested in booking a Safari holiday. 
- To share information about what is offered at Sable Safari, including general information, accommodation and activities. 
- To give users the opportunity to ask questions through a simply enquiry form. 
- To allow users to navigate between pages with ease, and to keep the design and colour palette fairly consistent. 

## Research 

### Market Review 

Before designing the website, I reviewed the market by looking at other safari websites based in Zimbabwe and South Africa, in order to get a feel of how they presented themselves, which content and features they offered, and the design choices they made in terms of colour palette. I also reviewed what appeared to work well for the user and what needed improvements. 

[Victoria Falls Safari Lodge](https://victoria-falls-safari-lodge.com/) | [Zambezi Drift](https://www.zambezidrift.com/about-us/) | [Ilala Lodge](https://www.ilalalodge.com/) | [African Bush Camps](https://africanbushcamps.com/camps/bumi-hills-safari-lodge/) | [Bush Lovers Safari](https://www.bushloverssafari.co.za/)

### Key Takeaways from Market Review 
- The website should be eye-catching, to make travellers excited about booking with their chosen Safari
- The Website should be clean, simple and easy to navigate
- Hero images should be vibrant and relevant to the safari theme
- Images and video content are key features to advertise the safari well
- Navigation and social media links should be easily accessible 

## User Stories
- User Story 1: As someone interested in booking a holiday at Sable Safari I want to:
     - find out general information about the Safari and what they offer
     - see and listen to media content of what they offer
     - contact the administration if I have any questions or want to book
     - navigate easily between pages

- User Story 2: As a booking company on behalf of travellers I want to: 

- User Story 3:

These user stories gave me a clear scope for the website and enabled me to stay on track with the project, preventing scope issues at a later stage after the coding process. 


## Design, Layout and Structure 
The design, layout and structure was consistent across all pages for certain elements, such as the colour palette for headings, paragraphs and backgrounds, the design of the navigation bar and footer and the social links. However, the layout of each page was slightly different, to allow users to differentiate between different pages easily. On each page, I incorporated a lot of visual content, such as eye-catching images, bold colours and a video.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled me to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style.

<details><summary>About Us</summary>
<details><summary>Accommodation</summary>
<details><summary>Activities</summary>
<details><summary>Enquiry</summary>

### Structure

The structure of this website was informed by the principles of interactive design (IXD), the scope and the user and business goals of Sable Safari. These were all kept in mind to ensure that the website conformed to user's expectations and needs. 

The site is made of a simple, four page structure:
- About Us
     - Gives the users a brief introduction to Sable Safari, as well as a video of the infamous Victoria Falls, a summary of reasons to stay there, and some eye-catching images of up-close encounters with wildlife. 
- Accommodation
     - Shows the users the different rooms available, including pictures, information and prices. 
- Activities
     - Displays the four activities that travellers can engage in when they arrive at Sable Safari, using images side by side with information about each activity.
- Enquiry
     - Displays a simple, easy-to-fill-in form for users who have questions about Sable Safari, as well as more information to further attract users into booking. 

There is also a subpage:
- Thank you
     - The user will be brought here after submitting the enquiry form correctly. 

The site has a navigation bar which is consistent in design across all four pages, with the full page names (About Us, Accommodation, Activities, Enquiry) showing for desktop screens, and the relevant icons only showing for Ipad/Tablet and mobile screens. The navbar was reduced to icons to prevent it from taking up too much real estate on smaller screens and to give a cleaner appearance overall. The navbar allows users to access any page they need and is useful for both new and returning users. There is also a footer with consistent design across all four pages, to allow users to visit the social media sites of Sable Safari at any time, and to contact them should they wish to book a holiday or ask questions. 

On the About Us page, there is also another method of navigation, through the "Find out more" buttons directly below the "Why Stay With Us?" section. This allows users to immediately visit gain access to further information about either the accommodation or activities offered by Sable Safari. 

The suggested route is ABOUT US > ACCOMMODATION/ACTIVITIES > ENQUIRE

### Colour 

I chose to use a bright, bold design using safari-themed colours sunset shades of orange, white and black for effective contrasting and green to differentiate buttons, prices and copyright information from other content.

### Font

My choice of font was [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/?query=baskerville) for all paragraphs and [Libre Baskerville Bold](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=baskerville) for all headings. Both font choices were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and had a backup font of Sans Serif. I chose these fonts for my website because they both have an elegant, professional and welcoming finish which is best suited for a website aiming to attract its users. The boldness also displayed a strong legibility as headings over images, text and videos. 

### Imagery
In the top, left corner of each page, a Safari logo with paw icons on either side can be seen. Clicking it will direct the user back to the "About Us" page.

</details>
- This section gives the user a brief history of Sable Safari, as well as a catchy, brief overview of what is offered at the Safari. 
- It then shows the user four reasons to stay at Sable Safari, to encourage them to explore other aspects of the website like accommodation and activities. 

### Accommodation page

     - This page welcomes the user with a brief, but enticing description of the accommodation offered. 
     - The user can then scroll to see the three types of accommodation offered. 
     - The layout shows a picture of the first type of accommodation on the left, and information about the room and it's facilities on the right. It then alternates with the second accommodation picture being on the right, with information on the left, and so on. 
     - This layout provides a visually appealing aesthetic and makes it easy for the user to learn more about the variety of accommodation they can stay in. 
     - Each image includes a text overlay with the name and price of each type of accommodation, to allow the user to make a more informed decision on which room to book. 

### Activities page
     - This page first provides a fun description of what activities are offered by the Safari. 
     - The user will then scroll to see four eye-catching, circular-shaped images of the different activities offered by Sable Safari.
     - Each image has a text overlap of the name of the activity, so the user can easily identify which activity they are interested in most. 
     - When the user hovers/clicks on the circular image, the image will flip over to reveal more information about the desired activity. This allows the user to interact with the website, providing a positive user experience.
