                        Safari Game Drives

                    <h3>What to expect</h3>
                    <p>
                        Game drives are the highlight of any safari! At Sable Safari, you can experience
                        Zimbabwe's natural beauty while getting the opportunity to see wildlife upclose 
                        in their natural habitats. Every game drive is unique, and totally depends on the 
                        time of day you choose to go. We recommend early mornings, late afternoons, or night-time
                        when the animals are more active because of the cooler weather.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Game drives last approximately 3 hours, which includes a break at our look-out point
                        where we'll stop to have complimentary drinks and snacks. Here, you'll be able to 
                        take in the beautiful views around you while sipping on a refreshing sundowner! Does it
                        get any better than that?
                    </p>
                    <h3>What to bring</h3>
                    <p>
                        We want you to feel comfortable and have the best experience with us, so please make sure you bring some 
                        binoculars to view animals in the distance, a hat and sunscreen to keep your skin from sizzling,
                        and lots and lots of questions for our rangers!

                    <h3>What to expect</h3>
                    <p>
                        White water rafting is one of the most exciting, adrenaline-pumping, electrifying 
                        experiences you'll ever take part in. Not only that, the Zambezi River is known to be 
                        arguably the best terrain for fast rapids, breath-taking scenery and gorgeous, white, sandy 
                        beaches where you can enjoy the tranquility of the gorge with a cold beer!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our rafting guides are extremely well-trained to ensure you will be instructed, guided and 
                        taken care of every step of the way. As long as you come ready to listen, learn and have
                        the best time of your life, you are guaranteed a day of endless memories! We'll provide the gear,
                        lunch and drinks to keep you equipped for some fun in the sun!
                    </p>
                    <h3>What to bring</h3>
                    <p>
                        It goes without saying, but you'll need a swimming costume that is tight-fitting, lots of 
                        sunscreen and closed shoes. Don't worry about life-jackets, helmets or boats... we've got that
                        covered!

                    <h3>What to expect</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Victoria Falls bungee jump is undoubtedly the most picturesque jump in the world. Free-fall
                        for 111 metres of pure adrenalin. This activity is not for the faint-hearted, but we believe with 
                        the right attitude and carefree spirit, bungee jumping can be fun for everyone. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our guides are excellently trained and know exactly how to secure your harness to ensure your safety
                        at all times. They will also talk you through the safety procedures and explain the whole process before
                        you take that leap of faith. Come on, you can do it!  
                    </p>
                    <h3>What to bring</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this activity, you'll need closed shoes, and clothing that is fairly snug (i.e. no dresses/skirts)
                        Also bear in mind that you must be atleast 15 years old to do this jump. Let's go!

                    <h3>What to expect</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a long, fun-filled day of exploring and taking part in the exciting activities we offer,
                        how does a relaxing dinner-cruise along the Zambezi river sound? Our sunset cruise is one of our
                        most popular, relaxing experiences for all travellers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We offer a three-course-meal made by our talented chefs, along with complimentary drinks and a band
                        to sing you a chorus of songs while you finish your dessert. The best part it, you'll be able to 
                        witness nature's wildlife: hippos, crocodiles and hopefully any animals looking for an evening drink!
                    </p>
                    <h3>What to bring</h3>
                    <p>
                        As it is a fancy dinner, we'd love it if you dressed in semi-formal evening attire. Other than that, 
                        please bring yourselves! We hope you enjoy the sunset!
