## Project Development and Planning 

The planning and development of this website was done using principles of User Experience (UX) design, which include the five planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. With these principles in mind, the aim was to ensure an easy-to-use, responsive and eye-catching website to meet the goals and needs of potential clients. 

### Project Goals 

- #### Project Purpose

     - The Sable Safari website is a site for tourists and local travellers looking to visit Zimbabwe and book an exciting safari getaway. Sable Safari offers accommodation and activities to meet the needs of all types of traveller: from adrenaline-junkies to wildlife enthusiasts, and even people who simply want to relax and enjoy the african sunset. 

     - Users will be able to find general information about the Safari getaway, as well as the various activities they can indulge in upon arrival. They can also look at the types of rooms they'd like to stay in, and make enquiries through the enquiry form page. 

- #### Target Audience

     - Sable Safari is designed for users who are interested in booking a safari holiday in Zimbabwe, and offers easy-to-navigate pages to allow travellers to get a feel of what is offered. 

## Research 

### Market Review 

Before designing the website, I reviewed the market by looking at other safari websites based in Zimbabwe and South Africa, in order to get a feel of how they presented themselves, which content and features they offered, and the design choices they made in terms of colour palette. I also reviewed what appeared to work well for the user and what needed improvements. 

[Victoria Falls Safari Lodge](https://victoria-falls-safari-lodge.com/) | [Zambezi Drift](https://www.zambezidrift.com/about-us/) | [Ilala Lodge](https://www.ilalalodge.com/) | [African Bush Camps](https://africanbushcamps.com/camps/bumi-hills-safari-lodge/) | [Bush Lovers Safari](https://www.bushloverssafari.co.za/)

### Key Takeaways from Market Review 
- The website should be eye-catching, to make travellers excited about booking with their chosen Safari
- The Website should be clean, simple and easy to navigate
- Hero images should be vibrant and relevant to the safari theme
- Images and video content are key features to advertise the safari well
- Navigation and social media links should be easily accessible 

## User Stories
- User Story 1: As someone interested in booking a holiday at Sable Safari I want to:
     - find out general information about the Safari and what they offer
     - see and listen to media content of what they offer
     - contact the administration if I have any questions or want to book
     - navigate easily between pages

- User Story 2: As a booking company on behalf of travellers I want to: 

- User Story 3:

These user stories gave me a clear scope for the website and enabled me to stay on track with the project, preventing scope issues at a later stage after the coding process. 


## Design, Layout and Structure 
I incorporated lots of visual content, such as eye-catching images.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled me to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style.

### Structure

### Colour 

I chose to use a bright, bold design using safari-themed colours sunset shades of orange, white and black for effective contrasting and green to differentiate buttons, prices and copyright information from other content.

### Font

My choice of font was [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/?query=baskerville) for all paragraphs and [Libre Baskerville Bold](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=baskerville) for all headings. Both font choices were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and had a backup font of Sans Serif. I chose these fonts for my website because they both have an elegant, professional and welcoming finish which is best suited for a website aiming to attract its users. The boldness also displayed a strong legibility as headings over images, text and videos. 

### Imagery
In the top, left corner of each page, a Safari logo with paw icons on either side can be seen. Clicking it will direct the user back to the "About Us" page.
